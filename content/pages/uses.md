As a [developer][developer] and [tech][tech] lover in general, I use a lot of physical and digital stuff on a daily basis.
These things serve many purposes. They bring me enjoyment, connect me to other people, and serve as tools that help me create software.

I'm constantly improving and upgrading my setup, so expect this to change in the future.

If you want to know more details or have any questions, ask me in my [AMA][ama].

## 🏠 home office

I use my home office as a place to stream, podcast, and code. This setup was recently slimmed down to just the essentials, which are kept on an [UPLIFT Desk][uplift].

### 💻 laptop

I used to have a custom PC, but I stopped playing games on the computer, so I was able to ditch the desktop and rely solely on a laptop.

### ⌨️ accessories

As for accessories, I love clicky mechanical keyboards and large palm grip mice. I also find that dual monitor setups on Windows machines help maximize my productivity.
