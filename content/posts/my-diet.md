In addition to having my [workout routine][my-workout-routine] dialed in, I have my diet on autopilot. I meal prep my protein sources each week, and I eat the same thing every day. While some might find it boring, I take pleasure in knowing my daily caloric intake and not having to make any decisions about what I eat.

## breakfast

| Name         | Quantity | Protein | Carbs | Fat | Calories |
| :----------- | :------- | :------ | :---- | :-- | :------- |
| [Eggs][eggs] | 5        | 30g     | 0g    | 25g | 350      |

I season my eggs with salt and pepper, and then add [guacamole salsa][salsa]. I also have a cup of coffee with cream and sugar.

## lunch

| Name                           | Quantity | Protein | Carbs | Fat | Calories |
| :----------------------------- | :------- | :------ | :---- | :-- | :------- |
| [Ground Beef][beef]            | 175g     | 37g     | 0g    | 8g  | 217      |
| [White Rice][rice]             | 120g     | 5g      | 40g   | 3g  | 200      |
| [Mixed Vegetables][vegetables] | 176g     | 4g      | 22g   | 2g  | 120      |

I put [ranch][ranch] dressing on this meal to give it some more flavor.

## dinner

| Name                           | Quantity | Protein | Carbs | Fat | Calories |
| :----------------------------- | :------- | :------ | :---- | :-- | :------- |
| [Ground Turkey][turkey]        | 175g     | 44g     | 0g    | 2g  | 187      |
| [White Rice][rice]             | 120g     | 5g      | 40g   | 3g  | 200      |
| [Mixed Vegetables][vegetables] | 176g     | 4g      | 22g   | 2g  | 120      |

I put [ranch][ranch] dressing on this meal to give it some more flavor.

## vitamins

| Name                         | Quantity |
| :--------------------------- | :------- |
| [Men's Multi Vitamin][multi] | 1        |
| [Fish Oil][fish-oil]         | 2        |
| [Vitamin C][vitamin-c]       | 1        |
| [Biotin][biotin]             | 1        |

## supplements

| Name                 | Quantity | Protein | Carbs | Fat | Calories |
| :------------------- | :------- | :------ | :---- | :-- | :------- |
| [Protein][protein]   | 2 Scoops | 48g     | 6g    | 4g  | 240      |
| [Creatine][creatine] | 1 Scoop  | 0g      | 0g    | 0g  | 0g       |

## macronutrients

So all in all, each day my macronutrient intake looks something like this. Again, this is my ideal day while maintaining a very restricted diet usually when I'm trying to lose body fat.

| Protein | Carbs | Fat | Calories |
| :------ | :---- | :-- | :------- |
| 177g    | 130g  | 49g | 1,634    |

![macros][macros]

In actuality, I usually snack on things like nuts, turkey pepperoni, dates, and fruit until I feel satisfied. I use the planned meals as a baseline of required calories, and then build on top of that if needed.

## water

I drink one gallon of water per day out of [30oz Yeti Rambler][yeti]. I finish one at each meal and one during my workout.

## alcohol

I do not restrict alcohol, and I do not count the calories from it. However, when I do drink I choose [whiskey][whiskey] with [Diet Coke][coke], which is a fairly low calorie option when compared to something like beer.

I also try not to let alcohol influence my eating decisions.

## cheat meals

Every week I like to have a cheat meal. It helps keep me on my diet, and gives me something to look forward to. My favorites are [Domino's][dominos], [In-N-Out][in-n-out], and [Chik-fil-A][chikfila].
