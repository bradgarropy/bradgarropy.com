It's that time of year again! Time to reflect on the past year and see how I measured up to my goals. This is the second year I've posted my [resolutions][resolutions], and I feel it really helps me stay on track throughout the year. Let's see how I did.

## 💏 marriage

I think a few months into the year my wife _hated_ hearing the same question every morning! But starting each day with a nice conversation with my wife instead of wandering around groggy helped us start each day feeling more connected and aligned.

## 🐶 roman

Unfortunately, I did not do well at this particular resolution. We did cut his nails at home a few times and bathed him a few times. But I didn't keep this up at the cadence I intended.

His old age really started to show this year, as his hearing and eyesight are much worse. He's also been a bit more anxious. Honestly quality time with him on the couch is probably what he'd enjoy the most.

## 🤠 daily texas country

Over the course of 2020, [Daily Texas Country][dtxc] grew immensely. Starting as just a [Twitter][dtxc-twitter] bot, DTXC now has a [website][dtxc], a [YouTube][dtxc-youtube] channel, a [Spotify][dtxc-spotify] account, an [Instagram][dtxc-instagram] profile, and a [Facebook][dtxc-facebook] page.

I produce lots of different types of content for the brand. I've got blog posts, playlists, weekly [Whiskey Wednesday][whiskey-wednesday] videos, and even an [apparel store][dtxc-store]!

Some quick stats about Daily Texas Country. I've written 22 blog posts and created 46 videos. The website gets an average of 20 views a day, videos get an average of 15 views, I wrote an [article][koe] that got 2400 views, and I've made $16 from apparel sales so far.

While there's nothing particularly impressive about these numbers, it's a great starting point for growth in the next year!

## 📺 youtube growth

This year was huge for me as far as content creation goes. I published 21 new videos and grew my [YouTube][youtube] channel to 300 subscribers! The majority of my videos were pre-recorded and covered specific tutorial topics, like [plop][plop] or [npm packages][npm].

I transitioned to [Twitch][twitch] and continued to stream, a lot actually. I'm now a _Twitch Affiliate_ with 165 followers and 6 subscribers, which has made me about $50 so far.

## 🎨 adobe

I was very upfront with my [manager][manager] about wanting a promotion, and she delivered! I got promoted to _Senior Software Engineer_ at [Adobe][adobe]! The promotion came with a great raise, but no shift in priorities or role, just an increased expectation of accountability and leadership.

## 🏋🏼‍♂️ fitness

Due to COVID, my summer cut was actually more of a fall cut. But it [went great][cut] nonetheless, I lost 13 pounds in 8 weeks. I backed out of it a little faster than I would have liked, but I kept my workouts consistent and habitualized my water intake goals.

## 💵 finances

With the promotion at work, we easily paid off the new family vehicle. We're also depositing more into our retirement and savings accounts by default, as they're based on a percentage of my salary.

Despite the difficult circumstances in 2020, I did exceedingly well with nearly all of my resolutions. I'll be writing down my goals for 2021 in the next few days, so keep an eye out for those!
