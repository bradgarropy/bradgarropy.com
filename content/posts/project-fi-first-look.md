After making the big switch from an [Apple iPhone 7][1] to the [Google Pixel 2][2], I was downright pissed when I realized that AT&T does not support WiFi calling on the Pixel 2. This was just one more reason to leave AT&T, as we get terrible cell reception at our house. So I went searching for a new cell provider and [Project Fi][3] naturally seemed like a good fit.

## enticing features

Unlike some of the other major carriers who try to entice you with streaming subscriptions, Project Fi focuses on getting the basics done right.

### google's customer service

If you've ever called in to Google's customer service for any product at all, you know that it's second to none. And if you've ever called into AT&T's customer service then you know what it feels like to be punched in the gut. I know that Google will do what is right to solve any issue that may come up.

### great mobile app

One thing I never liked about cell service providers is how it always felt like a guessing game when it came to how much data was used by what apps and how that affected my bill. Project Fi's mobile app is a simple and straightforward way to manage your data usage. You can set alerts at certain thresholds, see your usage history, and sort by application.

### pricing structure

I love the pricing structure, it couldn't get any simpler! $20 for my line and $10 per gigabyte that I use. I typically travel been home and work, both of which are extremely "connected" environments, so I have WiFi everywhere. I used Project Fi's [calculator][5] to estimate my average monthly cost, which was around \$40.

What's even better is that there's a built in unlimited plan. If you use more than 6gb ($60) of data, it's free after that! That means you'll never get a bill higher than $80! This puts Project Fi in direct competition with the unlimited plans from [AT&T][6] and [T-Mobile][7].

### no sim required

If you have a [compatible phone][8], you don't have to go into a store to activate Project Fi. Just download the app, sign up, and you immediately have service.

## just the beginning

It may seem like I'm gushing about Project Fi even though I just signed up, but Google's Project Fi is making everything about cell service convenient for the user. And to me, that's what makes a great wireless provider. So far I'm loving the service, and I'm looking forward to watching my bills go down in the coming months.
