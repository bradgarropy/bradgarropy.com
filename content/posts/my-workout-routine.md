Over my years of experience exercising, I've come to realized that a hybrid approach to training is the most effective way to keep me strong, athletic, and flexible. Here is the five day split that I'm currently running.

I start each session with a power lifting movement. I work up to a heavy set of anywhere from one to five reps. I use periodization to increase my strength over time.

After the power lifting exercise I transition to bodybuilding exercises that focus on hypertrophy and time under tension. I vary these exercises to ensure even growth. I also swap between dumbbell, cable, and EZ bar movements to stimulate muscles differently.

To round out the week I like to go for a long run to make sure my cardiovascular health stays in check.

## Running

| Distance | Heart Rate | Pace             |
| :------- | :--------- | :--------------- |
| 5 Miles  | 160BPM     | 9:30 Mins / Mile |

I do my best to keep my heart rate under that limit while hitting the target pace. I also tend to throw in a few shorter 1-2 mile runs after a workout to include more cardio, which bumps my weekly mileage to about 10 miles.
