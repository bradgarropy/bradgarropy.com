I just wrapped up a [successful 2024][2024-in-review] with a clearer vision of [what really matters][what-really-matters]. But the new year is already underway so it's time to set my goals in stone and get to work. Here's what I want to accomplish in 2025.

## 😼 more adventurous marriage

I feel like I say this one every year, but me and Gaby love going out country dancing at [Mavericks][mavericks]. We want to break out of the mold and be more adventurous. A couple things we have on our list to do _instead of dancing_ include:

- arcade
- pickle ball
- raquet ball
- axe throwing
- boxing class
- rock climbing
- latin dancing
- nice restaurants

We are also in the process of planning our ten year anniversary trip. Instead of going to a beach like we usually do, we are taking a week long trip to New York City that will allow us to experience a ton of new things together and create some new lasting memories.

## 👷🏼‍♂️ just build stuff

In the past I've focused on building software applications to make money. While that is still a great goal, this year I want to focus on projects that I _actually want_ to build. Hopefully this will lead to more follow through on my end. I have a backlog of ideas that might be interesting to bring to life.

- loteria
- pictionary
- workout planner
- super bowl squares
- school pick up scheduler

I also plan to document the process on my [YouTube channel][youtube]. I used to say I never created content because I wasn't building enough, so tackling personal project for fun should provide me with lots of ideas to publish.

## 🇲🇽 more spanish conversations

Last year I hit [1000 days][1000-days] on [Duolingo][duolingo] and I gained a lot of confidence in my ability to have full conversations in Spanish. I even went as far as purchasing [Duolingo Max][duolingo-max] to leverage AI to help me learn. But it's not as good as I had hoped for, and there's no substitute for real life conversations. So this year I want to make it a point to have more Spanish only conversations with my wife and kids.

## 💪🏼 lean for summer

I normally cut during the summer to get a little leaner, but last summer I had just wrapped up my half marathon and I was still hybrid training both lifting and running. While that kept my weight low, around `182`, I was lacking muscle mass.

This year we have a trips planned to Mexico and New York, so I want to look good. My goal is to get down just under `180` pounds. Going back to my traditional training methods of bodybuilding workouts mixed with low intensity cardio, paired with a high protein / low carb diet, should do the trick.

## 😶‍🌫️ understand caffeine and alcohol

Over the holiday break I was eating a lot and found that drinking coffee in the morning didn't make my stomach feel great. I also indulged in plenty of whiskey in the evenings. So right after the new year I finished my last bottle of whiskey, and stopped drinking coffee in the mornings.

I'm not saying I want to quit caffeine and alcohol necessarily, but I will never understand how my body feels without it if I don't take a break. So I'm considering this an experiment in hopes that I learn some things about my body, and then I'll decide if I want to reintroduce those things back into my life.

## 🙌🏼 more social with online friends

I'm grateful to have made so many web development friends online over the past few years. And just like my real life friends, I want to put more effort into staying in touch with them.

I plan to do this through [Discord][discord] channels, voice chats, and direct messages. I love the idea of opening up a voice chat channel and making myself available for anyone who wants to stop by. This is made even easier now that [Discord][discord] is both on the MacBook while I'm coding, and on the [Playstation][playstation] while I'm gaming.

## 🎮 play more games

Last year I read no books but played a lot of games, and I honestly had a great time! I should use my free time to relax, not to keep filling my brain with productivity tips. So here are some games I plan to play this year.

- [Diablo IV][diablo]
- [Balatro][balatro]
- [Vampire Survivors][vampire-survivors]
- [Wayfinder][wayfinder]
- [The Plucky Squire][plucky-squire]
- [Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2][warhammer]

## 🎸 more physical things

I spend way too much time on a computer as it is, and I want to introduce more physical hobbies in my life. I have a few interests outside of coding that have piqued my interest lately, and I think it would be good if I pulled those threads to see where they lead.

- piano
- guitar
- drumming
- 3d printing
- [raspberry pi][raspberry-pi]

We have plenty of instruments at home, so I should spend some dedicated time practicing them to improve. It would be really cool to develop a new skill.

Recently I was researching a lot about web hosting and thought to myself, _"What if I could just run a [Raspberry Pi][raspberry-pi] and host whatever I wanted?!"_ And that thought lead me down a rabbit hole to _"What if I had a cluster of [Raspberry Pi's][raspberry-pi] hosting applications and I 3D printed a server rack for them?!"_ So there's definitely something there to explore.

## 🎬 conclusion

Looking back at at this list there aren't a lot of concrete goals. No dollar amounts, subscriber counts, or analytics numbers. This year I want to focus on [what really matters][what-really-matters] and spend my free time with the people I love, and doing the hobbies I enjoy.

No pressure, no stress, just chill vibes in 2025.
