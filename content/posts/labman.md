Nowadays I use [GitHub][github] quite a bit. I'm always making new [repositories][repos], improving my project management skills, and open sourcing more [packages][packages]. One crucial part of my project management strategy is tracking work through [issues][issues] and organizing them with labels.

But each time I start a new repository, I have to manually recreate my labels. Out of the box [GitHub][github] doesn't support copying labels, so I created [labman][labman].

[labman][labman] is a CLI tool that clones issue labels from repository to repository. I made it executable with `npx`, so there is no overhead to get up and running. I also wanted to be crystal clear about the changes it makes to your labels, so I included some colored command line output. I made this all happen with the following technologies.

- [node][node]
- [npx][npx]
- [octokit][octokit]
- [yargs][yargs]
- [chalk][chalk]

So if you spin up a lot of new projects, or just want consistent issue labels across your repositories, give [labman][labman] a shot! I even created my own [labels][labels] repository as a template for the labels I like.
