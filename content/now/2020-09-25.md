Living in Pflugerville and still loving our neighborhood. Pretty stuck in place right now during the [pandemic][covid]. The kids are a handful but we're surviving!

Recently got promoted to Senior Software Engineer at [Adobe][adobe]. Working as a lead frontend developer on [Product Recommendations][prex] and Search.

Working out of my [home office][office] and [streaming][twitch] quite a bit. Trying hard to push myself to the next level of web development by making full blown applications. Currently working on [MURPHY][murphy], a crossfit murph timer built with [Svelte][svelte], [Tailwind CSS][tailwind], [Netlify Identity][identity], [Stripe][stripe], and [FaunaDB][fauna].

Three of my friends are getting married this year and I'm a groomsman for all of them! Doing a little mini-cut to prepare for wedding season.
