I'm still working at [Atlassian][atlassian], and change is the only constant. I've been on a few teams and have had more than a few managers. Currently I'm on the [Confluence Reliability][confluence] team, and I'm hoping for a promotion in the near future.

Outside of work I've been focusing on home improvements. We got a new roof and gutters, painted the interior and exterior of the house, and are currently redecorating everything. We're going for an aztec / southwestern vibe.

After a coworker showed me the [Nike Run Club][nrc] app, I got really into running. I've been following the guided runs in the app, and typically run about 30 miles a month. I still lift five times a week, so now I can officially call myself a hybrid athlete.

I got a [Nintendo Switch][switch] and have been loving it! I played my first ever Zelda game, [Tears of the Kingdom][totk], and put about 150 hours into it. I also went back and replayed [Hades][Hades] because it's just too much fun.

Although I haven't been coding much outside of work, I have been going to more meetups around Austin. It's been great getting out into the community.
