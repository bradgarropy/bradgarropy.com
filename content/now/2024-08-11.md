I ran my first half marathon! Although the actual event got cancelled due to storms, I ran 13.1 miles around Pflugerville in `1:52:58`. Now I'm back to four strength sessions and two runs per week. I missed lifting heavy so much!

After being declined a promotion, I got tired of the lack of progression and constant change at [Atlassian][atlassian] so I got a new job at [Stripe][stripe]! I start with an week of onboarding in San Francisco at their headquarters.

This summer has been great with the kids. We took a trip to [upstate New York][cow] and it was so amazing to breath the fresh air and get away from it all! We also spent a lot of time at the roller skating rink this summer. I grew up skating so this was my comeback, I even bought myself a new pair of [skates][skates]!

I finished a few more [Nintendo Switch][switch] games, like [Super Mario Odyssey][mario], but the real kicker is that I won a [custom PS5][playstation] from [Sentry][sentry]! So I've been continuing my gaming habit on there. [God of War Ragnarok][god-of-war] and [Returnal][returnal] have jumped out as early favorites, and I'm really looking forward to [Astro Bot][astro-bot].
