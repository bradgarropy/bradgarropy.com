Lots, and I mean _LOTS_, has happened since the last update.

I sold some [developer shirts][curly-bois] and made a few hundred bucks off of them. Then I headed off to my buddy's bachelor party and [tore my achilles][achilles]. I documented my [recovery][recovery], which took around six months, and I'm still not completely back to normal.

During the recovery I revamped my [Twitch][twitch] setup. I created new [overlays][overlays] for my channel as well as a [chat bot][twitch-bot]. Then I published a bunch of `npm` packages. This open source work taught me a lot about documentation, [community][discord], and the importance of [TypeScript][typescript]. All this open source work motivated me to create a [GitHub sponsors][sponsors] page, which then sparked a [website redesign][website] to better highlight my work and [my sponsors][my-sponsors].

Here's the exhaustive list of everything I released.

- [eslint-config][eslint-config]
- [eslint-config-react][eslint-config-react]
- [eslint-config-svelte][eslint-config-svelte]
- [eslint-config-typescript][eslint-config-typescript]
- [use-countdown][use-countdown]
- [hue-sdk][hue-sdk]
- [http][http]
- [gatsby-seo][gatsby-seo]
- [gatsby-link][gatsby-link]
- [next-seo][next-seo]
- [next-link][next-link]
- [plop-generator-react-component][plop-generator-react-component]
- [plop-generator-react-hook][plop-generator-react-hook]

Austin randomly got snow twice, and the second time we lost power and water for almost a week! I also got my [COVID vaccine][vaccine], which allowed us to get out [dancing][dancing] more. Sadly I sold my [motorcycle][motorcycle], but I can't be too down about it because I took the money and [lifted my truck][truck].

I joined [Polywork][polywork], talked with James Perkins on [Developers Hangout][developers-hangout], and launched a podcast called [Web Dev Weekly][wdw] with [Richard Gottleber][richard-gottleber].

And if all that wasn't enough, I've been exploring new opportunities. I interviewed with some pretty cool companies.

- [Stripe][stripe]
- [Cloudflare][cloudflare]
- [Airtable][airtable]
- [Cypress][cypress]
- [Remix][remix]
- [Hashnode][hashnode]

Needless to say, I've needed a way to unwind in the evenings, so I've been playing some [World of Warcraft][wow] to get my mind off coding.
