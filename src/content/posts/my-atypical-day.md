Lately folks like [Chris Coyier][chris-coyier], [Dan Mall][dan-mall], and [Dave Rupert][dave-rupert] have been sharing what their typical day looks like. I figured I'd do the same, although this is not my typical day. With the pandemic and my [torn achilles][achilles], things are a bit different for me. But here it is nonethless.

**`6:45AM`** Wake up, brush my teeth, and wash my face.

**`7:00AM`** Do my physical therapy exercises while my wife gets the kids up. These exercises include stretching my leg and ankle, and then working on weight bearing.

**`7:30AM`** Do my best at wrangling the kids while my wife makes breakfast.

**`8:00AM`** Breakfast with the family. Five eggs and a cup of coffee every day.

**`8:30AM`** Post my daily goals on [Twitter][twitter], then start work at [Adobe][adobe]. I have just enough time to clear my inbox, answer some Slack messages, and review the Jira board before morning standup. Then it's coding until lunch time.

**`12:00PM`** Lunch with the family. Beef, rice, and some veggies every day. Lunch is more relaxed than breakfast because my wife and I meal prep, so it's just a matter of microwaving some tupperware.

**`12:30PM`** Another session of physical therapy exercises, still focusing on stretching the leg and ankle, and then weight bearing.

**`1:00PM`** Back to work. More coding, maybe a meeting but usually not.

**`4:00PM`** Family time! We take the kids out in the yard to play when the weather is nice and try to tire them out. This is usually where I give my wife a break.

**`5:00PM`** More physical therapy exercises, again with the focus on stretching and weight bearing.

**`5:30PM`** Do my best at wrangling the kids while my wife makes dinner. The TV is usually on at this time, but their attention span is limited.

**`6:00PM`** Dinner with the family. Chicken, rice, and some veggies every day.

**`6:30PM`** Bath time, get the kids ready for bed.

**`7:00PM`** Put down our son. Our daughter gets to stay up another hour and watch a movie or do whatever mommy and daddy are doing. I do one final session of physical therapy exercises, this time focusing on banded resistance movements for ankle strength.

**`8:00PM`** Put down our daughter. Freedom! Usually I head back to the computer to work on side projects. This means [coding][github], [blogging][website], [streaming][twitch], or [recording][youtube]. On nights where I just don't feel like being productive, I'll watch some tutorials or a TV show. On rare occasions I'll play a video game, lately it's been [Tony Hawks' Pro Skater][thps]. At least once a week my wife and I eat a cheat meal and spend time together.

**`12:00AM`** Lights out.

Usually I work out from **`7:00PM`** to **`8:30PM`** and then start the rest of my night, but the [achilles injury][achilles] is putting a damper on that. Once things get back to normal maybe I'll write a post called **my typical day**.

_I'd like to see what a typical day looks like for [James Quick][james-quick] and [Brian Morrison][brian-morrison]._
