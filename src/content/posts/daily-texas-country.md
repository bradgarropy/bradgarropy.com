Ever since I first stepped into a dance hall I've loved Texas country music. I started building a [playlist][playlist] back in 2013 that now has over 1100 songs. I met tons of friends out at the shows and the bars, but I've always wanted a larger community around the music that shaped my life.

So I came up with [Daily Texas Country][dtxc], my very own home for Texas country music and lifestyle that I could share with the folks who understood. The site contains [articles][blog], [videos][episodes], and [playlists][playlists] all created by me to share my thoughts and hopefully earn a buck later on down the line.

The site is statically generated, and sources the content from many different places. The [blog][blog] is a collection of markdown files stored right in the [repository][repo]. The Whiskey Wednesday [episodes][episodes] are hosted on the Daily Texas Country [YouTube channel][dtxc-youtube]. And finally, the [playlists][playlists] live in Spotify.

I used a few different pieces of [Jamstack][jamstack] and [serverless][serverless] technology to stitch the website together.

-   [Gatsby][gatsby]
-   [React][react]
-   [styled-components][styled-components]
-   [Netlify][netlify]
-   [Google Cloud Scheduler][gcp]
-   [Spotify][spotify]
-   [YouTube][youtube]
-   [ConvertKit][convertkit]

So if you happen to like Texas country music, or want to know more about the tech I used to create this side project, [take a look][dtxc]!
